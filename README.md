# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built with Python and Pygame. It allows users to visualize how common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort work step by step, displaying the sorting process in real-time.

## Features
- **Visualization**: Displays the sorting process with colored blocks, representing the data being sorted.
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **User Controls**:
  - Reset the array with random values.
  - Toggle between ascending and descending sorting order.
  - Choose sorting algorithms interactively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed and the `pygame` library. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Project
Clone or download this repository.
Save the code in a file named sorting_visualizer.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the file using
```bash
python sorting_visualizer.py
```

A window will open displaying the visualization.
